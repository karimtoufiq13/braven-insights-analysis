## Key Insights

- **Overall Satisfaction**:  
  76% of participants reported that Braven enhanced their career or graduate school prospects ‚Äúquite a bit‚Äù or ‚Äúa great deal.‚Äù

- **Site Comparison**:  
  - **Site 1**: 62% of participants expressed high satisfaction.  
  - **Site 2**: Higher performance with 68% reporting strong improvements, indicating potential strategies for replication at Site 1.

- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**:  
  - 30.3% Promoters  
  - 26.06% Passives  
  - 43.64% Detractors  
  Addressing detractor concerns could significantly shift the program‚Äôs public perception.

- **Skill Confidence Analysis**:  
  - **Job Search Self-Efficacy**: Mean = 5.87 (high confidence)  
  - **Career Self-Efficacy**: Mean = 5.98 (high confidence)  
  - **Networking Self-Efficacy**: Mean = 3.52 (low confidence), suggesting a need for targeted support in building networking skills.
